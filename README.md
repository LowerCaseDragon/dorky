# dorky. something that i like
A slab of code made to practically simplify the sharing of all of my mini code projects.

Well... First off. You run the code. I prefer you use Python 3.7.2 since that's what I use and I have seen that this tends to give people problems when it isn't used so... To stay on the safe side. Use 3.7.2.

First you arrive here. Seems simple enough right? Tell it your name.

And now... You get the option to do the questionare or not! Don't worry you'll always be able to go back and do this.

From here (Regardless of wether you've done the questionare or not.) you'll be thrown into the menu. Things should be a bit self explanitory from here right? Choose a number and you'll be thrown into it!

From here... Have your fun! Check back for updates!
